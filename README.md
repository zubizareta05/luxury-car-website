# Luxury-car-website
This website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a website that showcases a varieties of luxury vehicles. I wanted to use API from websites like Carfax and Edmunds, but all the car websites don’t have APIs available to the public, instead I attached a link to a different website in the “discover now” button of my website that redirects you to a website with listings of luxury cars.
